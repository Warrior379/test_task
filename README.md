Simple Spring Boot Project

I created a REST API using Spring framework. 

I used PostgeSQL as our database. 

User object has below attributes:
Login(unique),
Full Name,
DOB,
Gender,

This object is stored in database.
There is /user endpoint with 4 verbs GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. 
Using this endpoint, post data into database.
I have been created unit-tests for service layer.
